# Introduction
## Why do I select this topic as my final semester capstone project?
- Tourism industry‚Äôs crucial contribution to Malaysia's Gross Domestic Product ‚úàÔ∏è
- Industry badly affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic üò∑
- Post Covid-19 recovery on path for the travel industry üìà
- Huge potential in utilising Machine Learning to attract tourists (*and for the whole industry*) ü§ñ

## What is the problem statement of the project?
- The lack of a predictive model and focus on identifying tourist preferences has led to inefficient planning of domestic tour packages by Malaysian tourist operators

## Research Questions / Answers I am finding üåü
In addressing the issues associated with the design and scheduling of the tour packages, a few questions were developed:
- How to effectively cluster the collected data into several clusters for classification?
- What are the predictive modelling approaches that could effectively provide an accurate prediction of tourists‚Äô clusters for efficient planning of domestic tour packages?
- What are the valid recommendations that could be provided to the relevant authorities to enhance the scheduling of tour package?

## Aims & Objectives
The aim of this project is to develop a novel **data mining solution** to accurately predict tourist travel preferences for the scheduling of domestic tour packages in Malaysia.

With this, the 3 objectives of the project are listed below:
- To develop a clustering model to effectively cluster the collected data into respective clusters for classification purposes.
- To develop data mining models using predictive modelling approaches to predict tourist travel clusters for efficient planning of domestic tour packages.
- To draft relevant and valid recommendations for the relevant authorities.

# Methodology
## What methodology was use to carry out the project?
- ‚ÄúCRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining‚Äù or CRISP-DM methodology 
- Frequently used for data science projects and is the standard data mining methodology used to obtain useful information from the dataset
- 6 stages invovled in CRISP-DM

The data was collected through a questionnaire survey with the [All Questioned Asked](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-F5-BUVTxxIqGTwiTcCSBmVmTaE4-8XCIREsdPRw248/edit)

# Conclusion
Aims - **Accomplished**
- K-Modes clustering model was successfully developed with the data collected from a questionnaire survey.

Objectives - **Accomplished**

- A total of 4 models were developed (LR, DT, ANN and RF)
- Suggestions on future model iterations provided & Potential collaborations with relevant stakeholders provided
- Eventually, ANN was selected as the final model to be deployed due to its high prediction accuracy and better evaluation metrics as compared with the others.
