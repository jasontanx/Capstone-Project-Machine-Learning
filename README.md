# Introduction
## Why do I select this topic as my final semester capstone project?
- Tourism industry‚Äôs crucial contribution to Malaysia's Gross Domestic Product ‚úàÔ∏è
- Industry badly affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic üò∑
- Post Covid-19 recovery on path for the travel industry üìà
- Huge potential in utilising Machine Learning to attract tourists (*and for the whole industry*) ü§ñ

## What is the problem statement of the project?
- The lack of a predictive model and focus on identifying tourist preferences has led to inefficient planning of domestic tour packages by Malaysian tourist operators

## Research Questions / Answers I am finding üåü
In addressing the issues associated with the design and scheduling of the tour packages, a few questions were developed:
- How to effectively cluster the collected data into several clusters for classification?
- What are the predictive modelling approaches that could effectively provide an accurate prediction of tourists‚Äô clusters for efficient planning of domestic tour packages?
- What are the valid recommendations that could be provided to the relevant authorities to enhance the scheduling of tour package?

## Aims & Objectives
The aim of this project is to develop a novel **data mining solution** to accurately predict tourist travel preferences for the scheduling of domestic tour packages in Malaysia.

With this, the 3 objectives of the project are listed below:
- To develop a clustering model to effectively cluster the collected data into respective clusters for classification purposes.
- To develop data mining models using predictive modelling approaches to predict tourist travel clusters for efficient planning of domestic tour packages.
- To draft relevant and valid recommendations for the relevant authorities.

# Methodology
## What methodology was used to carry out the project?
- ‚ÄúCRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining‚Äù or CRISP-DM methodology 
- Frequently used for data science projects and is the standard data mining methodology used to obtain useful information from the dataset
- 6 stages invovled in CRISP-DM

The data was collected through a questionnaire survey with the [All Questioned Asked](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-F5-BUVTxxIqGTwiTcCSBmVmTaE4-8XCIREsdPRw248/edit)

# Project Implementation
## Data Understanding
- Initial Data Exploration Repo: [Click Here](https://github.com/jasontanx/Capstone-Project-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Initial%20Data%20Exploration)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repo: [Click here](https://github.com/jasontanx/Capstone-Project-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis)
  - Univariate Analysis
  - Bivariate Analysis

## Data Preparation & Clustering (Phase 1)
- Data Pre-Processing & Clustering Repo: [Click Here](https://github.com/jasontanx/Capstone-Project-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Data%20Pre--Processing%20%26%20Clustering)
  - Level Combination (Combining the levels in categorical variables that had many levels) 
  - E.g. The ‚Äúage‚Äù variable initially had a total of 4 categories. However, the last two categories only account for less than 5 observations. As such, ‚Äú35-49 years old‚Äù group and ‚Äú50 and above‚Äù group were combined with the ‚Äú26 - 34 years old‚Äù group)
  - Unsupervised Learning: K-Modes Clustering

## Data Preparation & Modelling (Phase 2)
- Data Pre-Processing & Modelling Repo: [Click Here](https://github.com/jasontanx/Capstone-Project-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Data%20Pre-Processing%20%26%20Modelling)
  - Feature Selection: Boruta Algorithm (Finding the answer of...*which variables does not play a significant role in predicting the dependent variable?*)
  - Label encoding and One-hot encoding
  - Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Artificial Neural Network (ANN) / Random Forest

## Deployment

# Conclusion
Aims - **Accomplished**
- K-Modes clustering model was successfully developed with the data collected from a questionnaire survey.

Objectives - **Accomplished**

- A total of 4 models were developed (LR, DT, ANN and RF)
- Suggestions on future model iterations provided & Potential collaborations with relevant stakeholders provided
- Eventually, ANN was selected as the final model to be deployed due to its high prediction accuracy and better evaluation metrics as compared with the others.
